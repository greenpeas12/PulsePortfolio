<h1>campaign strategy & optimization logic</h1>

<section>
  <h2>strategic objective</h2>
  <p>
    the primary objective is early-stage engagement and trust formation rather
    than immediate conversion. given category saturation, pulse prioritizes
    emotional resonance and perceived understanding over feature differentiation.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>target segmentation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>primary:</strong> gen z students and early-career professionals
      experiencing burnout but skeptical of prescriptive self-improvement tools.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>secondary:</strong> productivity-oriented users open to wellness,
      but resistant to motivational rhetoric.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>strategic logic (insight → action)</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>externalize blame:</strong> campaign messaging reframes burnout as a
      systemic condition rather than a personal failure, reducing user defensiveness
      and increasing receptivity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>optimize onboarding for reassurance:</strong> early touchpoints
      emphasize emotional validation and adaptive intent before introducing
      functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>signal transparency:</strong> marketing and product narratives
      expose simplified reasoning behind ai recommendations to build trust.
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>campaign roadmap (6 weeks)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>weeks 1–2:</strong> awareness via short-form content centered on
      shared burnout narratives and social validation.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>weeks 3–4:</strong> engagement through storytelling that introduces
      pulse as a responsive companion rather than a productivity tool.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>weeks 5–6:</strong> activation using low-friction trials emphasizing
      personalization and adaptive support.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>optimization framework & metrics</h2>
  <p>
    success is evaluated using early-stage behavioral indicators rather than
    immediate conversion, reflecting the category’s trust-heavy dynamics.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>session depth:</strong> average number of meaningful interactions
      per session during onboarding.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>return rate (7-day):</strong> percentage of users who return within
      a week of first interaction.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>onboarding completion:</strong> proportion of users completing the
      initial adaptive setup flow.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    messaging and channel allocation are revisited if emotional disengagement
    signals appear, even in the absence of click-through decline.
