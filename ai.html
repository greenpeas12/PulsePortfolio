  <h2>example questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>why does the strategy prioritize reassurance over conversion?</summary>
    <p>
      early-stage conversion in the wellness category is constrained by trust
      formation. market signals indicated that users disengage when they feel
      judged or instructed too early, making reassurance a prerequisite for
      later activation.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>which insight most strongly shaped the campaign?</summary>
    <p>
      the reframing of burnout as a systemic outcome rather than a personal
      failure directly informed messaging tone, creative restraint, and the
      decision to delay feature explanation.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>what would break this strategy?</summary>
    <p>
      if emotional validation is not followed by tangible behavioral progress,
      users may perceive the product as passive. the strategy assumes adaptive
      support can later demonstrate utility.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>why avoid feature-heavy messaging?</summary>
    <p>
      feature enumeration triggers premature comparison in a saturated market.
      delaying features preserves curiosity and allows meaning to precede
      evaluation.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>how would you adapt this strategy if engagement dropped?</summary>
    <p>
      engagement decline would first prompt analysis of emotional tone rather
      than channel performance, with messaging adjusted before budget changes.
