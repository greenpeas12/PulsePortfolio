      wellness discourse frames burnout as an individual failure, but engagement

      emphasize self-discipline.

      emotional disengagement during onboarding, indicating that reassurance
      outperforms instruction in the first user sessions.
    </li>
    <li>
      while personalization is expected, users exhibit higher trust when systems
